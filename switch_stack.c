 * Here's what 'switched_stack_suspend' does:
 * 
 * PIOR TO entering GDB (via the context switch introduced by
 * 'rtems_task_suspend()'):
 *
 *  1) everything that was dumped on the stack as a result of the
 *     exception is copied to a private memory area (exception frame
 *     and the exception handler call stack, local vars etc).
 *  2) stack frame link chain is relocated and fixed.
 *     'msg' and 'msg->frm' pointers to the current RtemsDebugMsg are
       relocated.
 *  3) stack pointer and frame pointer registers are switched to the
 *     new, private stack.
 *     The SP and stack as seen by GDB is as if no exception handler
 *     existed.
 *
 *  CAVEAT: exception handler and routines called from it MUST NOT
 *          USE addresses to variables on the stack with the exception
 *          of the RtemsDebugMsg pointer passed to the 'notify' routine.
 *          This pointer is relocated by switched_stack_suspend().
 *
 * AFTER leaving GDB:
 *  1) private stack is copied back to the task stack area UNDERNEATH
 *     the saved SP (msg->frm->esp0), i.e., GDB is allowed to push stuff
 *     on the stack (it does so to call code on the target).
 *  2) stack frame link chain, 'msg' and 'msg->frm' pointers are relocated
 *  3) stack and frame pointer registers are switched back to the task
 *     stack.
 *  4) When the exception handler returns, it pops the exception frame
 *     and returns to EIP as found in the exception frame...
 *
 * Here's a schematic:
 *
 *  a)  prior to exception   frame ptr  FP -> prev_frame original frame
 *                                            ..........
 *                           stack ptr  SP -> .......... original bottom
 *  b)  exception happens,
 *      prologue executes
 *      and handler is entered:        -----> prev_frame original frame
 *                                     |      ..........
 *                                     |  --> .......... original bottom
 *                                     |  |   .......... \
 *                                     |  |   saved pc   |
 *                                     |  |   saved regs | exception frame
 *                                     |  --- saved sp   |
 *                            FP ----> ------ saved fp   /
 *                                            ..........
 *                            SP ---------->  .......... 
 *                                            
 *
 *  c)  stack is copied to private area:
 * 
 *      private stack:                  task stack:
 *
 *      ------------------------------------> prev_frame original frame
 *      |                                     ..........
 *      |  ---------------------------------> .......... original bottom
 *      |  |   .......... \
 *      |  |   pc         |
 *      |  |   regs       | exception frame
 *      |  --- sp         |
 * FP-> ------ fp         /
 *             ..........
 * SP----->    .......... 
 *                                            
 *
 *  d) GDB modifies task stack (pushes frames)
 * 
 *      private stack:                      task stack:
 *
 *      ---------------------------------   -> prev_frame original frame
 *      |                                |  |  ..........
 *      |  ---------------------------   |  |  .......... original bottom
 *      |  |   ..........  \           | |  |  xxxxxxxxxx \
 *      |  |   pc (GDB mod)|           | |  |  ...yyy.... |
 *      |  |   regs (GDB)  | exception | -> -- ..fp...... | GDB pushed frame
 *      |  --- sp (GDB mod)| frame     |       .......... |
 * FP-> ------ fp (GDB mod)/           |------>.......... /
 *             ..........
 * SP------>   .......... 
 *                                            
 *
 * e) AFTER return from 'notify' -- stack switched back:
 *
 *                                          task stack:
 *
 *                                          -> prev_frame original frame
 *                                          |  ..........
 *                                          |  .......... original bottom
 *                                          |  xxxxxxxxxx \
 *                                          |  ...yyy.... |
 *                                     -->  -- ..fp...... | GDB pushed frame
 *                                     |       .......... |
 *                                     |  ---->.......... /
 *                                     |  |   
 *                                     |  |   ..........  \ 
 *                                     |  |   pc (GDB mod)|
 *                                     |  |   regs (GDB)  | exception
 *                                     |  --- sp (GDB mod)| frame 
 *                                FP-> ------ fp (GDB mod)/
 *                                            ..........
 *                                SP------>   .......... 
 *
 * f) after return from exception
 *                                          task stack:
 *
 *                                          -> prev_frame original frame
